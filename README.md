# Hello, Welcome to my Before & After Assignment

## I am Carolina, a student at SAIT

I will pick 5 number and 5 string modifiers questions to do, they were provided by my teacher. Each will have their own js file with a name according to what it is.

## Number Modifications

You can find it in number mods folder.

1. Incrementing and decrementing a number. Each inside their respective, numIncrement.js and numDecrement.js.
2. Converted to String. Inside numConvertToString.js
3. Floating Point Precision. Inside numFloatingPointPrecision.js
4. Check if Integer. Inside numCheckIfInteger.js
5. Check if Not a Number. Inside numCheckNaN.js

### List of Methods in number modifications

- Number.isInteger()

They can be found in the string mods folder.

1. Checking how a string starts and if it matches. Provides a true or false. Inside checkStart.js
2. Extracting a substring from a string. Inside extractSubstring.js
3. Find the Index of a word in a string. Inside findIndex.js
4. Find the length of a word or string. Inside getLength.js
5. How to replace words in JS. Inside replace.js.
